## Introduction

The project contains solution to programming challenge posted at [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59d582cafbdd0b7ef90000a0)

The task involved using regex patterns based on many inputs to determine final output (read more in about section). 
I have created it at the beggining of my programming journey back at 2020 in Java, before the chat GPT era ðŸ˜‚ There is defenitely space for improvement.

As the officer, the player must review each immigrant and returning citizen's passports and other supporting paperwork against a list of ever-increasing rules using a number of tools and guides, allowing in only those with the proper paperwork, 
rejecting those without all proper forms, and at times detaining those with falsified information

### Task objective
The task was to create a constructor function (or class) and a set of instance methods to perform the tasks of the border checkpoint inspection officer.
